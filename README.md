# Walkie-Talkie

This is a walkie-Talkie client for iPadOS, MacOS, WatchOS and ios. This app is completely written with swift and UI written with swift UI. In the app you will be able to enter a channel number, the channel number could be almost anything, it could be an emojie,numbers,characters, or all of them combined. Then a websocket will be established with the server. You could send an audio to anyone else in the channel by pressing the "talk" button. Once you released the button your audio will be sent to other people in the same channel.
